# Statistical analysis of precipitation data with Python

Usually we use probabilistic approaches when dealing with extreme events since the size of available data is scarce to address the maximum for a determined return period. Precipitation data present challenges when we try to fit to a statistical distribution. This is an exercise done with 10 years record of precipitation for the Morropon station (Piura-Peru) affected by El Niño and La Niña events in years 98 and 99 respectively (download data here). Data processing was done with Python on the IPython Notebook interface.
